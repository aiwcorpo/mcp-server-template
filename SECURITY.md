# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub: Security tab of this repository, "Report a vulnerability"
(private vulnerability reporting). Do not open a public issue for a security problem.

Include the affected version (`pom.xml`), the tool involved, the version of the backend system and steps to reproduce.
In scope: a tool result that contains a record or child object the caller's policy denies, an id of a child object
(comment, attachment, version) that is served for a record it does not belong to, a change that lands outside the judged
record or scope, a way to make the server send a model-written query to the backend, a write against a backend version
that was never tested, and any path by which the backend credential reaches a log, a result or an error.

## Scope

In scope: the code of this repository. Out of scope: the platform library (`mcp-starter-lib`), the gateway, the credential
broker and the policies, which are separate repositories with their own policies; the backend system itself.

The invariants of the server and the tests that hold them are in `docs/security/SECURITY.md`.

## Supported versions

Only the latest released version receives fixes. Published versions are immutable; a fix ships as a new release.
