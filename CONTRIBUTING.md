# Contributing

The server follows the contracts of `mcp-contracts` and the library `mcp-starter-lib`. A change that needs a different
contract (a resource type, a query field, a credential type) starts as a `proposed` entry in `CONTRACT_CHANGES.md` of
`mcp-contracts` and waits for approval.

## Setup

JDK 25, Linux or macOS with bash 3.2 or newer; Windows only through WSL2. The platform artifacts come from Maven Central or must be
in `~/.m2` (see the README of `mcp-starter-lib`). No container runtime and no backend system are
needed: the tests run the whole server against an in-process stub backend (`StubBackend` in `mcp-app`).

```bash
./mvnw -B verify     # the same command runs in CI
```

`./mvnw -B verify` must pass before a merge. A new tool needs the items of the [tool guide](https://github.com/aiwcorpo/mcp-docs/blob/main/docs/developer/tools.md) in `mcp-docs`: risk, title,
`@ResourceRef` for every id it names, a closed argument schema, a negative test, and a row in the README table.
