# Contributing

The server follows the contracts of `mcp-contracts` and the library `mcp-starter-lib`. A change that needs a different
contract (a resource type, a query field, a credential type) starts as a `proposed` entry in `CONTRACT_CHANGES.md` of
`mcp-contracts` and waits for approval.

## Setup

JDK 25, Linux or macOS with bash 3.2 or newer; Windows only through WSL2. The platform artifacts must be in `~/.m2` or in
the registry named by `MCP_MAVEN_REPOSITORY_URL` (see the README of `mcp-starter-lib`). No container runtime and no backend system are
needed: the tests run the whole server against a stub backend.

```bash
ci/run.sh verify     # text checks, then clean verify; the same script runs in CI
```

`ci/run.sh verify` must pass before a merge. A new tool needs the items of `docs/jak-napisac-narzedzie.md`: risk, title,
`@ResourceRef` for every id it names, a closed argument schema, a negative test, and an entry in `docs/api/tools-catalog.md`.
